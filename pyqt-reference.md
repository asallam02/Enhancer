# PyQt
## Get Started
PyQt is a library for building apps in c and python. [This](https://www.pythontutorial.net/pyqt/) is a pretty good starting point if you have never tried it out before. The tutorials that I think are a bit more useful to get started straight away are below though:
- [Hello world project](https://www.pythontutorial.net/pyqt/pyqt-hello-world/)
- [How the frontend and backend connect (signals and slots)](https://www.pythontutorial.net/pyqt/pyqt-signals-slots/)
- [Creating a button](https://www.pythontutorial.net/pyqt/pyqt-qpushbutton/)
- [Creating a line entry widget](https://www.pythontutorial.net/pyqt/pyqt-qlineedit/)
- [Creating a main window with a toolbar](https://www.pythontutorial.net/pyqt/pyqt-qmainwindow/)
